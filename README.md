# Stardust Roadshow Lab

## Creating a Stardust Account
1. Go to https://dashboard.stardust.gg/
2. Create an email/password login, or connect with Discord/Google
3. Log in using your account landing on the home page of the dashboard
(Note, if you see an error like `Email already in use`, you probably already have an account with that email using a different login method. If you see this trying to login with google, you probably have an email/password account already created with that email)

You've now provisioned a Stardust game on chain!
